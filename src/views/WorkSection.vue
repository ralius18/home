          dates: ['June 2021', 'March 2023'],
          description: 'I joined Re-Leased as a junior developer until I got comfortable to the new and different stack than I was used to. This introduced me to working in an Agile development and using Git to its full potential as a development process. Re-Leased develops commercial property management software for clients to manage their real estate portfolios, so while the scope of this business is narrower, there was still a lot to explore and learn. This Full Stack role taught me a lot about working in a larger scale software business and got me used to the practices of web development.'

I put my university training as a software developer to the test, learned new languages and gained a more in depth understanding of computing systems from a software perspective. This job mainly consisted of projects requiring integration of third party apps, product development and bug fixing. The software is a modular based enterprise system covering broad areas such as financing, regulatory systems and reporting. This required me to learn about a wide range of topics relevant to our main clients of local councils.'

          description: 'This was my starting point in the IT industry after graduating from university. I worked as technical support, answering phone calls and helping customers with their phone and internet issues. NOWâ€™s main point of difference is the customer service provided, so it was extremely advantageous for a technically minded person such as myself to be customer facing and talk people through issues. I gained knowledge and experience in delivery of internet and phone lines along with basic troubleshooting of network connection issues.'
