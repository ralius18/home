    <h3>Personal Statement</h3>
    <v-card flat>
      I am a capable and competent software developer who is always keen to expand my knowledge and learn more
      tricks of the trade.
      Now that I have professional experience in the industry, I am starting to explore other aspects and ideas in
      my spare
      time. I have taken an interest in web development after working on some personal projects and have enjoyed
      creating them.

          In this job, I initially worked on training documentation for a new version of a system that was being
          introduced, and
          assisted the IT staff in various small projects. My role developed into becoming a member of the helpdesk team
          and problem
          solving for users at the company. I learned how an IT department is run in an industrial environment and what
          skills
          are important to keep it running efficiently, such as communication and organisation.

          I started this job as part of a voluntary program run by Hastings District Council to get school students out
          into
          the workforce to gain experience in the workplace. I was then offered a full time position over the 2014/15
          holiday

          as the
          significance of health & safety in the workplace.
