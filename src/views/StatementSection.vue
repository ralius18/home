        I am a capable and competent software developer who is always keen to expand my knowledge and learn more
        tricks of the trade.
        Now that I have professional experience in the industry, I am starting to explore other aspects and ideas in
        my spare
        time. I have taken an interest in web development after working on some personal projects and have enjoyed
        creating them.
