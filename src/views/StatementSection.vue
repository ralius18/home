        I am a resourceful and adaptable Intermediate Software Developer with 5 years experience in a wide range of technologies.
        I have had a recent focus on Front-End and UX development as I thoroughly enjoy seeing the positive impact it can make.
        As a lifelong learner, I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and bring new ideas to my work.

        I am also very interested in the world of music and audio production.
        I have been involved with music since I was young and have lately started exploring the world of audio engineering.
        Recently I have had the opportunity to be mixing live gigs for small, local venues and learning a lot from those around me. -->
