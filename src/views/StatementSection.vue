        As a software developer, I am passionate about creating innovative solutions that make a difference in people's lives.
        With years of experience in the industry, I have developed a strong foundation in programming languages such as C#, JavaScript and Ruby
        as well as a focus on software development methodologies such as Agile and Scrum.
        I am also a lifelong learner, always looking for ways to improve my skills and bring new ideas to my work.
        I thoroughly enjoy working on front-end ideas and user experience to make a positive impact on people.

        I am also very interested in the world of music and audio production.
        I have been involved with music since I was young and have lately started exploring the world of audio engineering.
        Recently I have had the opportunity to be mixing live gigs for small, local venues and learning a lot from those around me.
